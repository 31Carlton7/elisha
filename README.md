## About

Elisha is a simple Bible app that is focused on personal use. I made this app in hopes to get people who aren't connected to God or who are, to read/study the Bible in a very simple format and manner that is more or less intended towards younger crowds, however this app is very useable for older crowds as well. No matter if you read 10 chapters a day or read just one verse, that is all it takes to connect with God and I hope this app can help anyone who uses it do too üôèüèæ.

When I was thinking about the first app I would make and publish on the app store, I thought carefully. I believed that God gave me the knowledge to be able to program/code in general so why not make my first app, an app to honor him and show thanks to him.

## Developer Info

To build the app I utilized the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev) as the UI Framework and that uses [Dartlang](https://dart.dev) as the programming language. The list of packages the app uses can be found [here](https://github.com/31Carlton7/elisha/blob/master/pubspec.yaml) under the dependencies indent. My UI Package I use to curate the UI can be found [here](https://github.com/31Carlton7/canton_design_system), however I will not be publishing the package on pub.dev anytime soon. This project is null safe. I also used Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to better understand the users who use the app, as well as Firebase Auth for authentication. Credits to [RKeplin](https://github.com/rkeplin/bible-go-api) for the initial Bible API.
